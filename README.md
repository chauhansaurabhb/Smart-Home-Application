A home consists of several rooms, each one is equipped with heterogeneous entities in order to provide residents comfort, safety, and situation awareness. To ensure the safety of residents, fire detection application is installed. It aims to detect fire by analyzing data from sensors and notify residents (also actives alarm) in case of fire. To accommodate a residents comfort, database server is used to keep profile of each resident including his/her preferred temperature value. For the situation awareness, system generates status of current environment parameter such as temperature, humidity, and outside temperature by interacting with yahoo weather service.
We developed Smart Home Application using three different approaches, 
1) General purpose programming Languages- In which developers have freedom to write code in any programming
language, and they are responsible for end-to-end application development.
2) Cloud based approach- In this approach, we considered Node-RED tool- A open source tool to wire new devices, APIs, and web-service in a very efficient manner.
3) Model driven development- This approach reduces programming efforts to develop IoT applications such as Smart Home Application by abstracting heterogeneous complexity of the system. It separates different aspects of the system in a modular way to develop IoT applications.
